- 👋 Hi, I’m @InsaneYeti
- 👀 I’m interested in creating meaningful moments for people as they use the websites and applications I build--moments that help them connect and re-engage with the world in a transformative way. My desire is get my hands on every possible tool that can help me accomplish this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web and app development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work that helps me in some of the aforementioned.
